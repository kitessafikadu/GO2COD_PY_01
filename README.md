Number Guessing Game
This project is a simple, fun Number Guessing Game, developed as part of my internship at GO2COD. The goal of the game is for the player to guess a randomly generated number within a given range in as few attempts as possible.

Features
Random Number Generation: Generates a new random number for each game session.
User Input and Validation: Accepts user guesses and provides feedback to guide the player toward the correct number.
Attempts Tracker: Tracks and displays the number of attempts taken by the player.

How It Works
The game selects a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).
The player inputs a guess, and the game indicates whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, and it then displays the total number of attempts.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Random (for number generation), tkinter(for GUI)
